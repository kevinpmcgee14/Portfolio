# Demos & Projects

Hello! My name is Kevin, thanks for stopping by!

Included in this repo are links to some small demos and projects I have worked on that showcase some of my skills:

### Demos

* [Land Classification Demo](https://github.com/kevinpmcgee14/Land_Classification) includes a notebook used for training a CNN to identify different land types from satelite imagery using Pytorch. It includes the custom implementation of the popular Unet architecture that is dynamically created based on the specified backbone architecture.

* [Building Footprints Demo](https://github.com/kevinpmcgee14/Building_Footprints) includes a notebook used for training a CNN to identify building footprints using TensorFlow.

* [Chlorophyl Prediction API](https://github.com/kevinpmcgee14/cholorophyll-app) is an api that serves expected chlorophyl content of corn based on incoming hyperspectral data. Includes the model training using Sklearn, API development using FastAPI, and deployment to Heroku and Docker.

* [GeoPandas Demo](https://github.com/kevinpmcgee14/geopandas_demo) is a brief demo parsing a geojson of building footprints using GeoPandas and Shapely.

### Projects and Packages

* [SageMaker Helpers](https://github.com/kevinpmcgee14/sagemaker-helpers) is a package of functionality that I have regularly used to make the development and deployment of models in [SageMaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/whatis.html) easier. Current functionality is around deployment of endpoints and configuring production variants, but will be looking to add functionality around [SageMaker Pipelines](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pipelines/) to help automate end to end life cycles.

* [Pytorch Training Utils](https://github.com/kevinpmcgee14/PytorchTrainingUtils) is a package of metrics, callbacks, and trainer wrapper that I use for training models in PyTorch. It allows for easy integration of new training techniques and makes training very user friendly overall.

* [Airbnb NYC Rentals](https://github.com/kevinpmcgee14/short-term-rental-prices-nyc) is part of the Udacity Machine Learning DevOps Engineer nanodegree program. This project uses [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) and [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) to automate and track ML experiments in a modular and reproducible fashion.

* [Salary Predictor](https://github.com/kevinpmcgee14/ml_api_demo), another project part of the Udacity Machine Learning DevOps Engineer nanodegree program, focusses on building a deploying a live API for the trained model.

* [Tweet Sentiment](https://github.com/kevinpmcgee14/Tweet_Sentiment) is a small application that plots general sentiment about tweets over the past week. In there, you'll find the notebook used for training as well a small application written using [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/). Model is trained with PyTorch.

I regularly add and tinker with these projects, so these will be updated and more projects will be added as time goes on.
