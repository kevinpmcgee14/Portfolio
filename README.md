# Portfolio

Hello! My name is Kevin, welcome to my portfolio!

![headshot](headshot.png?raw=true)

Included in this repo are links to some small demos and projects I have worked on that showcase some of my skills:

### Demos

* [Building Footprints Demo](https://github.com/kevinpmcgee14/Building_Footprints) includes a notebook used for training a CNN to identify building footprints using TensorFlow.

* [Land Classification Demo](https://github.com/kevinpmcgee14/Land_Classification) includes a notebook used for training a CNN to identify different land types from satelite imagery using Pytorch.

* [GeoPandas Demo](https://github.com/kevinpmcgee14/geopandas_demo) is a brief demo parsing a geojson of building footprints using GeoPandas and Shapely.

### Projects and Packages

* [SageMaker Helpers](https://github.com/kevinpmcgee14/sagemaker-helpers) is a package of functionality that I have regularly used to make the development and deployment of models in [SageMaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/whatis.html) easier. Current functionality is around deployment of endpoints and configuring production variants, but will be looking to add functionality around [SageMaker Pipelines](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pipelines/) to help automate end to end life cycles.

* [Pytorch Training Utils](https://github.com/kevinpmcgee14/PytorchTrainingUtils) is a package of metrics, callbacks, and trainer wrapper that I use for training models in PyTorch. It allows for easy integration of new training techniques and makes training very user friendly overall.

* [AirBnB NYC Rentals](https://github.com/kevinpmcgee14/short-term-rental-prices-nyc) is part of the Udacity Machine Learning DevOps Engineer nanodegree program. This project uses [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) and [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) to automate and track ML experiments in a modular and reproducible fashion.

* [Tweet Sentiment](https://github.com/kevinpmcgee14/Tweet_Sentiment) is a small application that plots general sentiment about tweets over the past week. In there, you'll find the notebook used for training as well a small application written using [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/). Model is trained with PyTorch.

I regularly add and tinker with these projects, so these will be updated and more projects will be added as time goes on.

Thanks for stopping by!
