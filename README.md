# Portfolio

Hello! My name is Kevin, welcome to my portfolio!

![headshot](headshot.png?raw=true)

Included in this repo is some small projects I have worked on that showcase some of my skills:

* [Tweet Sentiment](https://github.com/kevinpmcgee14/Tweet_Sentiment) is a small application that plots general sentiment about tweets over the past week. In there, you'll find the notebook used for training as well a small application written using [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/). Model is trained with PyTorch.

* [Building Footprints](https://github.com/kevinpmcgee14/Building_Footprints) includes a notebook used for training a CNN to identify building footprints using TensorFlow.

* [Land Classification](https://github.com/kevinpmcgee14/Land_Classification) includes a notebook used for training a CNN to identify different land types from satelite imagery using Pytorch & FastAI.

I regularly add and tinker with these projects, so these will be updated and more projects will be added as time goes on.

Thanks for stopping by!
